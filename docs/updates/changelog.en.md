### v1.0 · Vallax launch
**January 12, 2026**
- Final UI refresh with a more minimal style and clean navigation for the end of the beta.
- Brand-new category system covering the complete catalogs for Wallapop, Milanuncios, and Todocoleccion (Vinted still can’t be categorized).
- New inverse Regex: works just like a standard Regex filter but excludes the patterns you want to ignore.
- You can now configure your own bot to avoid hitting VallaxBot’s rate limit.
- New Vinted-specific settings (language and country) to better scope searches tied to that marketplace.
- Added an in-app notification center for system notices.
- New keyword system grouped into buckets to keep searches simple.
