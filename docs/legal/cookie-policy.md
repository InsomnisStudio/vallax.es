## 1. Legal framework

This policy complies with Article 22.2 of Law 34/2002 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, informing you about the collection and processing of cookies.

## 2. What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files sent by a website’s server to your browser. They may include a unique identifier but never personal information such as your name or email. The browser stores them on your device and the site can read them on future visits. Other sites may send their own cookies but cannot access those belonging to VALLAX.

## 3. Cookies used

- **Essential first-party cookies** that are necessary for the site to function and are exempt from consent under Article 22.2 of the LSSI.
- **Cookies requiring consent** may also be installed and will be described with their type and purpose following the guidelines of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

## 4. Disabling or deleting cookies

Restricting or blocking cookies is not recommended because it can affect service quality and performance. However, you can disable them in your browser settings, blocking all cookies or certain types. Browsers are responsible for cookie management, so removal or deactivation must be done from there.
