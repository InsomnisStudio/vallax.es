## 1. Identification, purpose, and scope

**1.1 Service provider.**
- Vallax (brand under development)
- [vallaxdev@gmail.com](mailto:vallaxdev@gmail.com)
- [https://vallax.es](https://vallax.es)

**1.2 Scope.** These conditions apply to users who qualify as consumers under Article 3 of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007. If a user acts as a professional or business entity, consumer regulations do not apply and the parties are governed by the Spanish Civil Code and Commercial Code.

**1.3 Purpose of the contract.** These terms govern access to and use of the monitoring service and alert delivery for listings published on third-party platforms.

## 2. Acceptance of the terms

To subscribe, users must complete the process by selecting the desired plan and explicitly accepting these terms. After payment, the user receives a confirmation email.

## 3. Service description

- **Nature of the service:** VALLAX is a technological intermediary that automates the search for public listings across third-party platforms based on the filters defined by the user. It does not participate in any sale or transaction between users.
- **Operation:** Users can create customized searches. Whenever a matching listing is detected, Vallax sends an alert through Telegram.
- **Dependency on third parties:** Performance depends on the external platforms and may be affected by their changes or outages. VALLAX updates its software as quickly as possible to adapt to them.
- **Beta phase:** While the beta lasts, the service is free of charge but may include errors or changes without notice.
- **End of beta:** Once the beta is over, certain features may require a Premium subscription. Pricing, plans, and conditions will be announced in advance.

## 4. Access, registration, and user obligations

- Be at least 18 years of age and have legal capacity.
- Ensure the registration data are accurate and keep them up to date.
- Safeguard credentials and notify the provider if unauthorized use is detected.
- Use the service lawfully, refraining from illicit activities, reverse engineering, or actions that could damage the provider’s systems or those of third parties.

## 5. Pricing and subscription

- **Prices and plans:** Displayed in the “Plans” section of the website and include applicable taxes.
- **Payments:** Processed through the available methods (card, PayPal, etc.). The user authorizes charges via the chosen method.
- **Renewals:** Subscriptions renew automatically for equal periods unless the user cancels beforehand.
- **Price changes:** The provider may adjust fees with 30 days’ notice. If the user does not agree with the new price, they may cancel without penalty.

## 6. Right of withdrawal

- Consumers may withdraw within 14 days of signing up.
- This right does not apply to business or professional users.
- Exception: as a digital service that begins immediately, once the user expressly consents to the start of the service they lose the withdrawal right after receiving access.
- After subscribing, confirmation will be delivered on a durable medium that reiterates the consent provided.

## 7. Intellectual property

The provider holds the rights to the service, website, source code, design, databases, and the “VALLAX” brand. Subscribing grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license for personal use while the subscription remains active. Third-party content (listings, images, text, etc.) is owned by its respective authors, and VALLAX is not responsible for its legality or accuracy.

## 8. Liability and warranty disclaimer

The provider acts diligently but is not liable for interruptions caused by third-party platforms, the availability or removal of listings, user transactions, connection issues on the user’s side, or lost opportunities and indirect damages. The maximum liability is limited to the amount paid during the six months preceding the event that triggered the claim, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence.

## 9. Data protection

Data processing is governed by the Privacy Policy, which is an integral part of these terms and must be accepted before using the service.

## 10. Changes, severability, and communications

- The provider may update these terms and will notify users via the client area or email; if the changes are substantial, renewed acceptance will be required.
- Declaring a clause null does not affect the validity of the remaining clauses.
- Communications will preferably occur electronically using the emails supplied by both parties.

## 11. Governing law and jurisdiction

This contract is governed by Spanish law. Disputes will be submitted to the Courts of Orihuela unless the user resides outside Spain, in which case Orihuela’s jurisdiction is likewise accepted.
